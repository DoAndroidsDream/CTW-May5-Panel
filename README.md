### Motivating question:
> **Can we learn about _art_ and _visual imagination_ from _deep neural networks_?**


### Our panelists:
- Gizem Küçükoğlu: vision researcher at NYU will summarize brain models of visual perception/cognition.

- Dr. Matt Zeiler: founder of the AI Vision company Clarifai.
   - Matt’s deep neural network visualization techniques drove major breakthroughs in object recognition accuracy, winning for Clarifai the top five places in the 2013 ImageNet competition (beating entries from top AI research centers like Google, Microsoft, etc.)

- Dr. Nick Lambert, Art and culture historian and a major figure in CTW 2016.
